Given a Wikipedia topic and a tweet thread about it, describe a CONCRETE SUBJECT to illustrate it.

Rules:
- Describe a real, tangible thing: an object, animal, landscape, scene, tool, or artifact
- Never use abstract symbols, icons, typography, geometric shapes, or punctuation
- For abstract topics, find a physical object or scene that embodies the idea
- For people, describe their workspace, tools, or creations — never the person
- One sentence only. Describe only WHAT to draw, not the style or colors.
